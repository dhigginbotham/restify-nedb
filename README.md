# restify-nedb (for [nedb](https://github.com/louischatriot/nedb)) <img src="https://badge.fury.io/js/restify-nedb.png" align="right" />&nbsp;<img src="https://drone.io/github.com/dhigginbotham/restify-nedb/status.png" align="right" />

`restify-nedb` was built to give you restful api resources for client side application frameworks like `angular.js`, `ember.js`, `backbone.js` or `knockout.js` as well as give you a simple file/memory based cache utilizing [nedb](https://github.com/louischatriot/nedb). (ps, i love [nedb](https://github.com/louischatriot/nedb), you should too.) If you haven't already checked it out, maybe you want to use it separate of all of this extra stuff, do it. It's like sqlite, with a subset of mongodb's api. _Really neat._

### Heads up, she's still a baby
- Let me know if you have any issues, please open issues/prs etc, it's a lot more fun that way
- There's still a good chunk of the `nedb` api I need to wrap in, if you need the core crud stuff, this should work well for you
- I'd like to point out there coule be a few rough parts, but it's coming along.  

### Features
- Super fast `nedb` file/memory backed cache w/ simple garbage collection
- 100% coffeescript, hate it or love it 
- restful routing: `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE` 
- parses `json/multi-part`

### Installation (w/ Express)

##### Step 1) Install the app, automatically add the latest version in your `package.json`

```
npm install restify-nedb --save
```

##### Step 2) Configure your app, needs access to `app`, so you can do that a number of ways, `req.app`, `res.app`, `app.use`, `app`, etc..

```js

  /* example in .js */

var express = require('express');
var app = express();

var restify = require('restify-nedb').mount;
var config = require('restify-nedb').config;

var sampleMiddleware = function (req, res, next) {
  console.log('here\'s a sample middleware...');
  return next();
};

// default config options
var opts = {
  filePath: __dirname + '/db/filestore.db',
  maxAge: 1000 * 60 * 60,
  prefix: '/session',
  middleware: [sampleMiddleware]
};

// initialize our config object

cfg = new config(opts);

// if you aren't already using an nedb
// instance, then calling this will create
// one for you.
cfg.makeDataStore();

// builds routes
api = new restify(cfg, app);
```
----
```coffee
express = require "express"
app = module.exports = express()

restify = require("restify-nedb").mount
config = require("restify-nedb").config

sampleMiddleware = (req, res, next) ->
  console.log "here's a sample middleware..."
  next()

opts = 
  filePath: conf.app.paths.cache
  maxAge: 1000 * 60 * 60
  prefix: "/session"
  middleware: [sampleMiddleware]

cfg = new config opts

# if you aren't already using an nedb
# instance, then calling this will create
# one for you.
cfg.makeDataStore()

# builds routes
api = new restify cfg, app
```

## Configuration Options
Options | Defaults | Type | Infos
--- | --- | --- | ---
**ds** | `internal` | DataStore | allow for outside nedb processes to be restified. tip: `config.ds()` returns a new DataStore with whatever your `opts` are set to, once it's fired it will internalize and share
**prefix** | `/ds` | String | defines the first route path, for instance `http://localhost:3000/ds`
**version** | `/v1` | String | not preferred, as a rule i feel these aren't the best idea for your api, last thing you want is fragmentation in your api
**exclude** | `[]` | Array | excludes keys/values from the api, good for things like `password` 
**middleware** | `[]` | Array | middlewares, ie passport authentication, logging, analytics
**memoryStore** | `false` | Boolean | whether or not keep an in-memory store or a file based persistant store, defaults to `false`, we like persistant files.
**fileName** | `nedb-filestore.db` | String | file name for your nedb filestore
**filePath** | `../db` | String | bit easier to change the path and view the contents instead of digging through `node_modules`
**maxAge** | `1000 * 60 * 60` | Number | if set to `null` or `false` automated gc will be disabled
**store** | `undefined` | String | `not currently working` - will allow for multiple nedb collections, still working out the kinks.

## Routes

```md
GET http://localhost:3000/session/v1
POST http://localhost:3000/session/v1

GET http://localhost:3000/session/v1/:id
PUT http://localhost:3000/session/v1/:id
DELETE http://localhost:3000/session/v1/:id

GET http://localhost:3000/session/v1?id=:id
PUT http://localhost:3000/session/v1?id=:id
```
### Ordering

```md
GET http://localhost:3000/session/v1?limit=20
GET http://localhost:3000/session/v1?skip=10
GET http://localhost:3000/session/v1?sort=val
GET http://localhost:3000/session/v1?sort=-val
```

### Query / Searching

```md
GET http://localhost:3000/session/v1?key=value
```

### Additional

```md
PUT http://localhost:3000/session/v1/:id?append=true
```
- append defaults to false. Set to true to do something similar to `findAndUpdate`
 
```md
POST http://localhost:3000/session/v1
```

- `_stale` in your body/json will act as an override to `stale`, say you need some things to last longer/shorter than other cached items
 
##### Tests

```md
mocha test\crud.coffee -R spec --compilers coffee:coffee-script
```

##### Pro-tips
- I would recommend using something like [Advanced REST Client](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/advanced-rest-client/hgmloofddffdnphfgcellkdfbfbjeloo?hl=en-US) for testing, it'll help.
- If you want upto date / latest documentation run `cake docs`, this way if I forget, you can easily skim thru the source -- `/docs` should be included.
